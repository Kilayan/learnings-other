#### Leading Types of Simulation Models

1. Monte Carlo/Risk Analysis Simulation

* using empirical data of the real system's inputs and outputs to identifies uncertainties and potential risks through probability distribution
* Pro: bottom-line 

2. Agent-Based Modeling & Simulation

* Agent: people, equipment, and anything else. 
* The simulation includes agent's 'behavior', which serve as rules of how those agents must act in the system. Then look at how the system responds to those rules. 
* Cons: must draw your rules from real-world data. 

3. Discrete Event Simulation 

* Pros: enable user to observe the specific events that result in the business process. 

4. System Dynamics Simulation Solutions

* Does not include specific details about the system. 
* Pros: simulate for a long-term, strategic level view of the overall system. It is aiming to get aggregate-level insights about the entire system in response to an action. 

#### Use Cases

* Automotive: car in a virtual environment. Drive instruction. Pilot instruction. 

* Biomechanics: modeling human or animal anatomical structures in order to study their function and design medical treatments and devices. Surgical procedures. 

* City and Urban Planning

* Disaster Preparation

* Weather: uses simulation to predict extreme weather conditions such as hurricanes or cyclones. 

* Production system: use discrete event simulation to assess manufacturing processes, assembly times, machine set-up, and more.
